# TrollCave

Trollcave (1.2) is a VM available from [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/trollcave-12,230/) - a  "vulnerable VM, in the tradition of Vulnhub and infosec wargames in general. You start with a virtual machine which you know nothing about â€“ no usernames, no passwords, just what you can see on the network."
